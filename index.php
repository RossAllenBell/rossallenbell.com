Welcome to RossAllenBell.com! Because it's hard to guess, my name is Ross Allen Bell. There's not a whole lot here at the moment. Some day, when I become ambitious, I'll go ahead and create some real content. For now, I'll simply grace you with some god-awful coloring schemes and a resume that I'm sure I'll forget to update. Thanks for stopping by!

Oh, and if you need to contact me, drop me a line at RossAllenBell at gmail.
