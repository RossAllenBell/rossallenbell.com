<b>ATOL Data Visualizer</b> - This is a data visualization application I wrote while working at <a href="http://www.nasa.gov" target="_blank">NASA</a>'s Air Traffic Operations Laboratory (ATOL) at the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/home/index.html" target="_blank">Langley Research Center (LaRC)</a> on the <a href="http://www.epo.usra.edu/usrp/" target="_blank">USRP</a>. It would take data gathered from our laboratory test runs and allow us to "replay" the run and visualize exactly what happened. While I can't post the source code and distribution package here for anybody to freely download, I would be more than happy to provide either upon request. If interested, just send me a line at RossAllenBell at gmail.

I'm pretty sure some better commercial software out there exists for this purpose, but it was nice to write something "real" outside of work. I was surprised to learn how fun and relatively simple it is to write a compiler for the scripting language.</td>

This game was created by my team for a game programming class in the final semester of my undergraduate career.
