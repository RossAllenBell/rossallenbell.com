            <p><span class="project-title">Touchonauts</span> - My first "real" published game in the mobile space. It occurred to me that I hadn't yet seen a game that combined traditional Asteroids-like evasion game with an all-touch based set of controls. The game itself isn't strictly an Asteroids clone, and I'm really pleased with the end result. Also, I was delighted to find out how much fun it was to incorporate multi-touch.</p>

            <p><span class="project-title">Fluid Canvas</span> - While creating Summoners Convention, I was unable to find a suitable tool for creating HTML5 canvas objects that would autofill to their container sizes. I wrote this library to allow for the creation of configurable canvas objects that lended themselves to Javascript apps that desire to be all or a portion of the screen's size.</p>

            <p><span class="project-title">Strife Basin</span> - Written in Java, using 2D libraries, I wanted to recreate the Starcraft II custom map Nexus Wars. The game is currently designed as a two player game, connecting to an opponent over the internet. Although it currently exists as a fully working game, I haven't been actively developing on this project lately. If I pick this project back up, it will likely be in the form of porting it to a polished mobile version.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/RossAllenBell/StrifeBasin">github</a></p>

            <p><span class="project-title">Summoners Convention</span> - Written in node.js, this project was mostly an introduction to node.js. Once I had a fully working prototype, I decided the actual gameplay itself wasn't captivating enough to warrant further development. If you want to check it out in action, be sure to open it in two browser tabs.</p>

            <p><span class="project-title">Darkfall Gear Optimizer</span> - The original Darkfall Online (not its successor, Darkfall: Unholy Wars) had a very customizable gear system where you could equip any type of armor, however you were incentivized to gear towards a specific role. Essentially, the heavier your gear (ie: plate armor instead of leather), the more penalties you received to actions like casting spells or firing a bow. Heavier armor would cause you to suffer from <em>encumbrance</em>, and there were specific encumbrance levels you would aim for in a given player role. This tool would allow you to select the absolute best set of armor for your character. This required churning through millions of possible combinations to produce the subset of ideal gear sets. This was possible in about a minute through heavy use of custom hashing functions. The tool is no longer of use, as Darkfall Online was taken down to make way for its successor, but I keep it around as a good example of the type of number crunching achievable in Java.</p>

            <p><span class="project-title">ATOL Data Visualizer</span> - This is a data visualization application I wrote while working at NASA's Air Traffic Operations Laboratory (ATOL). Written in Java and using Java3D, it takes data gathered from our laboratory test runs and allows us to "replay" the run and visualize exactly what happened. While I can't post the source code and distribution package here for anybody to freely download, I would be more than happy to provide either upon request. If interested, just send me a line at RossAllenBell at gmail.</p>

            <p><span class="project-title">Toaster Tales</span> - A three level, side-scroller game for the Game Boy Advance.
