                Hey, I'm Ross Bell! I'm married to Shatra Bell, have a too-cool-for-me sister Alison, and parents Rick and Kathy. Shatra and I met while on the USRP at NASA Langley.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I spend my days at Backstop Solutions in Chicago. I love living downtown and haven't owned a car since college-ish.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interests include turning ideas into software, laughing at things, entertainment media, and going to the gym first thing in the morning.

            Some things from GitHub...

        <div class="project-section">
            <img width="50%" class="project-image-inline" src="./images/strife_basin.png"/>
            <p><span class="project-title">Strife Basin</span> - Written in Java, using 2D libraries, I wanted to recreate the Starcraft II custom map Nexus Wars. The game is currently designed as a two player game, connecting to an opponent over the internet. Development is still ongoing, although it currently exists as a fully working game. Most clearly missing is any sense of real game art.</p>

            <img class="project-image-inline" src="./images/jmacro.png"/>
            <p><a class="project-title" href="./jmacro/">JMacro<a/> - A tool to script human input. Development of this project is likely over, as it's currently stable within the feature set it was designed for.</p>

        <div class="project-section">
            <p><a class="project-title" href="http://rossallenbell.com:8080">Summoners Convention<a/> - Written in node.js, this was more an experiment to see what node.js was all about and whether or not I could use it write a real-time app in javascript. I was impressed with how it turned out, even if it was just created as a toy project.</p>

            <p><a class="project-title" href="parkaos/">Parkaos<a/> - I was curious how a platformer game would play in a browser. There's no actual game to play, but click the link to see how the platformer framework handles.</p>

            <p><span class="project-title">ATOL Data Visualizer</span> - This is a data visualization application I wrote while working at NASA's Air Traffic Operations Laboratory (ATOL) at the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/home/index.html">Langley Research Center (LaRC)</a> on the <a href="http://www.epo.usra.edu/usrp/">USRP</a>. It would take data gathered from our laboratory test runs and allow us to "replay" the run and visualize exactly what happened. While I can't post the source code and distribution package here for anybody to freely download, I would be more than happy to provide either upon request. If interested, just send me a line at RossAllenBell at gmail.</p>
