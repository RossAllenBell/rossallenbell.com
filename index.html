        </div>
        <p>
            My name is Ross Allen Bell. I'm married to Shatra Bell, have a too-cool-for-me sister Alison, and parents Rick and Kathy. Shatra and I met while on the USRP at NASA Langley.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I spend my days at Backstop Solutions in Chicago, and I can confidently say I've found a great place to work with an exceptional team. I love living downtown and haven't owned a car since college-ish.
        </p>
        <p>
            My interests include turning ideas into software, laughing at things, entertainment media, and going to the gym first thing in the morning.

                <td valign="top"><b><a href="http://JMacro.org" target="_blank">JMacro<a/></b> - This is a macro program and scripting language I wrote that allows you to script input events like key presses and mouse clicks. I'm pretty sure some better commercial software out there exists for this purpose, but it was nice to write something "real" outside of work. I was surprised to learn how fun and relatively simple it is to write a compiler for the scripting language.</td>

        <b>ATOL Data Visualizer</b> - This is a data visualization application I wrote while working at <a href="http://www.nasa.gov" target="_blank">NASA</a>'s Air Traffic Operations Laboratory (ATOL) at the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/home/index.html" target="_blank">Langley Research Center (LaRC)</a> on the <a href="http://www.epo.usra.edu/usrp/" target="_blank">USRP</a>. It would take data gathered from our laboratory test runs and allow us to "replay" the run and visualize exactly what happened. While I can't post the source code and distribution package here for anybody to freely download, I would be more than happy to provide either upon request. If interested, just send me a line at RossAllenBell at gmail.
