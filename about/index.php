My name is Ross Allen Bell.
I'm married to <a href="http://www.shatra.net/" target="_blank">Shatra Bell</a>, have a too-cool-for-me sister Alison, and parents Rick and Kathy.
Shatra and I met while on the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/postsecondary/programs/Undergraduate_Student_Research_Project.html" target="_blank">USRP<a/> at <a href="http://www.nasa.gov" target="_blank">NASA</a> <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/home/index.html" target="_blank">Langley</a>.

I was born in Houston, Texas on 1985-08-10.
I moved with my family at the age of about ten to Omaha, Nebraska.
I finished my undergraduate degree at the <a href="http://www.pki.nebraska.edu/" target="_blank">PKI</a> of <a href="http://www.unomaha.edu" target="_blank">University of Nebraska at Omaha</a> in Computer Science.
<p/>
Currently, I'm working at Backstop Solutions in Chicago, and I can definitely say I've found a great place to work with an exceptional team. I love living downtown and haven't driven a car since I lived in Texas. I'd be hard pressed to ever consider living in a "suburb" type situation again.
<p/>
My interests include <a href="http://www.java.com" target="_blank">Java</a>, artificial intelligence, and entertainment media.
I'm a huge movie fan, and when I'm not too busy, I like to wake up by going to the gym.
